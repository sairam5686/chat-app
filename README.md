### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**The `node_modules` directory is NOT included in this repository.** This folder contains the project‚Äôs dependencies (like `express`, `socket.io`, etc.), and it is excluded for the following reasons:

- **Size**: The `node_modules` directory can be very large, and it is not ideal to include it in version control (GitHub repositories).
  
- **Best Practices**: It is common practice in Node.js projects to exclude `node_modules` using `.gitignore`. All required packages are listed in the `package.json` file and will be installed when you run `npm install`.
